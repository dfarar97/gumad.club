# GU Mobile App Development Club

The goal of the Mobile App Development Club is to design and build mobile applications that will benefit the students of Gonzaga University and beyond. Members will learn the fundamentals and paradigms of mobile app development.

Members will need no previous knowledge of app development, only a willingness to learn about this exciting field. We will be working with a variety of platforms and organize a variety of projects for students to learn more about this field and put that knowledge into action.

# Learning git
Git is a super important part of the way we do things. If you join the club, you should learn git! We know it can be difficult, so we've setup [a tutorial here](https://gu-app-club.github.io/github) to help you out!
